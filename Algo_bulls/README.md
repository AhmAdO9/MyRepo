username: admin

password: 111

Inorder to hit an API, please make sure you have created an authentication token. For that purpose, i have created an authentication API. Send a post request to the API with the required fields i.e username and password. Once you do that, activate the token and you are good to go.

You can also use the admin credentials that I have provided above. Use that to get a token, and once you activate it, you can then access whichever API you want.
